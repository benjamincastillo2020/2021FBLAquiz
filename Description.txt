CODING AND PROGRAMMING
Develop an original computer program to randomly generate a five-question FBLA quiz from a database. The program must complete a minimum of the following tasks:
    Have at least 50 questions in the database with the ability to see correct answers
    Include at least 4 types of questions (i.e. multiple choice, T/F, fill-in-the-blank, matching, and dropdown, etc.).
    Inform the user which questions were correctly answered
    Calculate the total correct on the five-question quiz
    Generate a printable report on quiz results
    Data must be stored persistently. Storage may be in a relational database, a document-oriented NoSQL database, flat text files, flat JSON, or XML files.
    All data entry must be validated with appropriate user notifications and error messages including the use of required fields.
